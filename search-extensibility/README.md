## PnP Search Extensibility library

PnP Modern Search uses the concept of 'extensibility libraries'. These are SharePoint Framework library components you put in the global or site collection app catalog that will be loaded automatically by Web Parts to enhance the experience and options (ex: new data source with new options, custom layout, etc.). Simple as that!

## Get started

More information to get started can be found in the documentation for PnP Moderns Search at https://microsoft-search.github.io/pnp-modern-search/extensibility/.

## Summary

This solution creates a customizable Tiles Web part, it uses a stored collection from the PnP `PropertyFieldCollectionData` control and allows the user to choose the color scheme (theme or custom) and to set the size of the tiles. By default the tiles use a fluid flex layout to use the available screen area.

This is a rebuild of the awesome project created by @hugoabernier [https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/main/samples/react-tiles] so the credit goes to him!
